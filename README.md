# Discord-Bots
A small collection of (very bad) discord bots (That should really be 1 bot) written for my DND group. 

Average bot calculates what an opponents average save is based on previous saves it's made
HP bot keeps track of how much damage an opponent has been dealt
Initiative bot tracks initiative
Roll bot allows rolls
Utili bot was an *attempt* to combine them all into 1 that I never bothered to finish
  (It appears that Initiative tracking and Dice rolling work? You should be able to roll a dice using the number emojies separated by a b emoji (The result will also be emoji))
